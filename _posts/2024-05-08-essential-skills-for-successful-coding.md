I'm excited to be joining Sierra Space as a Systems Engineering Intern this summer in Denver, CO! This is an incredible opportunity to support mission analysis and contribute to innovative space vehicle design projects!

A special thank you to Sarah Zalucha for her communication and insights throughout this process. Additionally, thank you to Brandon Walther, Alexander Estey, and Alex Downs for their valuable career advice and engaging conversations.

As I prepare to graduate from The Ohio State University, I'm deeply grateful for the friends, colleagues, and professors who have supported and guided me along the way. My achievements wouldn't have been possible without your encouragement and the exceptional education I've received at OSU.

I look forward to making meaningful contributions at Sierra Space, and I'm excited to return to Columbus in the fall to complete my MS in Aerospace Engineering.
