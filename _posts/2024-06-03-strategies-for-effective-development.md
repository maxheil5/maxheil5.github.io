I'm excited to be joining Sierra Space as a Systems Engineering Intern in Denver, CO for the summer of 2025! I will be working on mission analysis and space vehicle design in the defense technology sector. This is a phenomenal opportunity to expand my horizon in the space domain and learn from industry leading engineers.
