I'm honored to share that my abstract on the TERRASat project has been accepted for presentation at the International Astronautical Congress (IAC) 2025, hosted by the International Astronautical Federation in Sydney, Australia.

TERRASat is a senior capstone mission developed at The Ohio State University that proposes a novel 12U CubeSat to measure localized magnetic fields in Mars orbitâ€”critical for assessing potential habitability and future human exploration. The project integrates advanced technologies, including atmosphere-breathing electric propulsion (ABEP) and AI-based computer vision to identify regions of interest, conserve power, and prioritize data transmission.

You can learn more about the mission <a href="https://maxheil5.github.io/project/terrasat-project" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>.

I'm excited to present this work on a global stage and contribute to the discussion around next-generation Mars science missions!

Congratulations to my fellow team members: Ian Harris, Jessica Sillus, Annabelle Zerby, Stephanie Small, and Svitlana Pryymachuk.
