In a unique opportunity, I was able to collaborate with 10 engineers from The Ohio State University to create an automated cryogenic refueling system for NASA's Human Lander System (HLS). Our design consists of a computer vision (CV) actuator alignment system that it used to autmatically connect two couplers for refueling on-orbit. For close proximity alignment, we developed an electromagnetic connection subcomponent that assists the AI alignment in the final compression phases. Through these methods, we reduce and possibly eliminate the need for constant human interaction when performing refueling missions in space. This will ultimately increase the likelihood for successful propellant transfer and help achieve NASA's efforts to conduct long duration missions to the Moon. This project was recently submitted as a proposal to NASA's Human Lander Challenge (HuLC). To learn more, read about the current status of the project below! This page will be updated with new information, when available.

## Background
<p>
  The <strong>Human Lander Challenge (HuLC)</strong> is a NASA-sponsored competition hosted by the National Institute of Aerospace (NIA) that invites university students to develop innovative solutions to some of NASA’s most pressing technology challenges for future lunar missions. In support of the <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/artemis" target="_blank">Artemis Program</a>, HuLC challenges multidisciplinary student teams to address a critical need for the <strong>Human Landing System (HLS)</strong>: sustainable, repeatable cryogenic propellant transfer in space. As future Artemis missions expand in scope and duration, the ability to reliably refuel lunar landers in orbit becomes essential for enabling long-term lunar exploration and eventual crewed missions to Mars.
</p>

<p>
  For the 2025 cycle, teams were asked to design conceptual architectures, hardware components, or operational strategies that support <strong>autonomous, zero-boiloff cryogenic refueling</strong> between depots, tankers, and landers in cis-lunar space. Proposals were evaluated based on their technical feasibility, originality, alignment with NASA’s objectives, and potential impact on future mission architectures. The HuLC program emphasizes not only creative engineering but also project planning, risk assessment, and system-level thinking, offering students the chance to contribute meaningfully to the development of next-generation space infrastructure.
</p>

<p>
  Participation in HuLC provides students with a platform to showcase engineering design, research, and innovation while engaging with NASA engineers and experts. As one of only a handful of universities selected to submit to the competition, our team at The Ohio State University developed a novel <strong>Autonomous Magnetized Cryo-Coupler with Active Alignment Control (AMCC-AAC)</strong>, focusing on fully autonomous docking and fluid transfer mechanisms critical for long-duration spaceflight. This proposal reflects both a technical and mission-oriented response to the vision laid out by NASA and underscores the importance of student-driven contributions in shaping the future of human space exploration.

## Technical Solution

<p>
  Our proposed solution, the <strong>Autonomous Magnetized Cryo-Coupler with Active Alignment Control (AMCC-AAC)</strong>, is a fully automated cryogenic docking system designed for propellant transfer in orbit. The design integrates three core subsystems:
</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Computer Vision-Guided Alignment:</strong> An onboard camera tracks ArUco markers on the receiving port, feeding real-time data into a control algorithm to actuate a 2-DOF linear stage for precise lateral and axial alignment.</li>
  <li><strong>Electromagnetic Capture Ring:</strong> An array of controllable electromagnets generates a soft-capture field to gently pull and hold the target interface during final docking, mitigating misalignment.</li>
  <li><strong>Cryogenic Refueling Interface:</strong> The coupler includes a spring-loaded cryo-seal and latch mechanism, enabling secure connection and fluid transfer under high thermal insulation constraints.</li>
</ul>

Development, on the other hand, is the engine that drives these digital experiences forward, translating design concepts into functional realities. With each line of code, developers breathe life into ideas, transforming visions into tangible products that enrich and empower users' lives. Agile methodologies empower development teams to adapt and evolve in response to changing needs, ensuring that products remain relevant and responsive in an ever-changing landscape.

## Branding and recognition

At the heart of every successful design and development endeavor lies the user experience. Understanding the needs, desires, and behaviors of the end user is paramount, guiding every decision and iteration throughout the design and development process. User research and testing provide invaluable insights, illuminating the path forward and ensuring that products resonate with their intended audience.
