In a unique opportunity, I was able to collaborate with 12 engineers from Ohio State to create an automated cryogenic refueling system for NASA's Human Lander System (HLS). Our design consists of a computer vision (CV) driven actuator alignment system that it used to autmatically connect two couplers for refueling on-orbit. For close proximity alignment, we developed an electromagnetic connection subcomponent that assists the AI alignment in the final compression phases. Through these methods, we reduce and possibly eliminate the need for constant human interaction when performing refueling missions in space. This will ultimately increase the likelihood for successful propellant transfer and help achieve NASA's efforts to conduct long duration missions to the Moon. To learn more, read about the current status of the project below! This page will be updated with new information, when available.

Development, on the other hand, is the engine that drives these digital experiences forward, translating design concepts into functional realities. With each line of code, developers breathe life into ideas, transforming visions into tangible products that enrich and empower users' lives. Agile methodologies empower development teams to adapt and evolve in response to changing needs, ensuring that products remain relevant and responsive in an ever-changing landscape.

## Branding and recognition

At the heart of every successful design and development endeavor lies the user experience. Understanding the needs, desires, and behaviors of the end user is paramount, guiding every decision and iteration throughout the design and development process. User research and testing provide invaluable insights, illuminating the path forward and ensuring that products resonate with their intended audience.
