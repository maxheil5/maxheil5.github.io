In a unique opportunity, I was able to collaborate with 10 engineers from The Ohio State University to create an automated cryogenic refueling system for NASA's Human Lander System (HLS). Our design consists of a computer vision (CV) actuator alignment system that it used to autmatically connect two couplers for refueling on-orbit. For close proximity alignment, we developed an electromagnetic connection subcomponent that assists the AI alignment in the final compression phases. Through these methods, we reduce and possibly eliminate the need for constant human interaction when performing refueling missions in space. This will ultimately increase the likelihood for successful propellant transfer and help achieve NASA's efforts to conduct long duration missions to the Moon. This project was recently submitted as a proposal to NASA's Human Lander Challenge (HuLC). To learn more, read about the current status of the project below! This page will be updated with new information, when available.

## Background
<p>
  The <strong>Human Lander Challenge (HuLC)</strong> is a NASA-sponsored competition hosted by the National Institute of Aerospace (NIA) that invites university students to develop innovative solutions to some of NASA’s most pressing technology challenges for future lunar missions. In support of the <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/artemis" target="_blank">Artemis Program</a>, HuLC challenges multidisciplinary student teams to address a critical need for the <strong>Human Landing System (HLS)</strong>: sustainable, repeatable cryogenic propellant transfer in space. As future Artemis missions expand in scope and duration, the ability to reliably refuel lunar landers in orbit becomes essential for enabling long-term lunar exploration and eventual crewed missions to Mars.
</p>

<p>
  For the 2025 cycle, teams were asked to design conceptual architectures, hardware components, or operational strategies that support <strong>autonomous, zero-boiloff cryogenic refueling</strong> between depots, tankers, and landers in cis-lunar space. Proposals were evaluated based on their technical feasibility, originality, alignment with NASA’s objectives, and potential impact on future mission architectures. The HuLC program emphasizes not only creative engineering but also project planning, risk assessment, and system-level thinking, offering students the chance to contribute meaningfully to the development of next-generation space infrastructure.
</p>

<p>
  Participation in HuLC provides students with a platform to showcase engineering design, research, and innovation while engaging with NASA engineers and experts. As one of only a handful of universities selected to submit to the competition, our team at The Ohio State University developed a novel <strong>Autonomous Magnetized Cryo-Coupler with Active Alignment Control (AMCC-AAC)</strong>, focusing on fully autonomous docking and fluid transfer mechanisms critical for long-duration spaceflight. This proposal reflects both a technical and mission-oriented response to the vision laid out by NASA and underscores the importance of student-driven contributions in shaping the future of human space exploration.
</p>

## Our Technical Solution

<p>
  To address the critical need for autonomous cryogenic refueling in orbit, our team developed a concept known as the <strong>Autonomous Magnetized Cryo-Coupler with Active Alignment Control (AMCC-AAC)</strong>. This system enables fully automated, precise docking and fluid transfer between cryogenic propellant depots and the Human Landing System (HLS), without requiring continuous human supervision. The system is composed of several integrated subsystems working in tandem to accomplish this goal.
</p>

<p>
  At the heart of our design is an <strong>active alignment control system</strong> guided by computer vision and sensor fusion. Using visual fiducials and an onboard camera, the system can detect and track the target interface in real time. This data is used to actuate a precision-controlled robotic end-effector, which dynamically aligns the coupler with its mating interface during final approach.
</p>

<p>
  To aid with the mechanical docking process, we introduced a novel <strong>magnetized capture ring</strong> that gently pulls the mating coupler into final alignment during the last few centimeters of approach. This subcomponent uses electromagnets to create a soft-capture interface that helps absorb small misalignments and ensures a tight mechanical seal—crucial for safe and efficient cryogenic fluid transfer.
</p>

<p>
  The combined use of passive visual tracking, active electromechanical control, and magnetic assistance results in a robust system that can adapt to positional variance and tolerances common in space operations. The AMCC-AAC enables repeated, hands-off fluid transfers across multiple mission phases, including depot refueling, tanker-to-lander transfers, and pre-surface descent staging, all while minimizing system complexity and the risk of boil-off.
</p>

<p>
  This design positions itself as a scalable component of future Artemis mission architectures and paves the way for sustainable, repeatable human exploration of the lunar surface and beyond.

Development, on the other hand, is the engine that drives these digital experiences forward, translating design concepts into functional realities. With each line of code, developers breathe life into ideas, transforming visions into tangible products that enrich and empower users' lives. Agile methodologies empower development teams to adapt and evolve in response to changing needs, ensuring that products remain relevant and responsive in an ever-changing landscape.

## Branding and recognition

At the heart of every successful design and development endeavor lies the user experience. Understanding the needs, desires, and behaviors of the end user is paramount, guiding every decision and iteration throughout the design and development process. User research and testing provide invaluable insights, illuminating the path forward and ensuring that products resonate with their intended audience.
